# Speed up Mail.app by vacuuming the Envelope Index
# - Code from: http://web.archive.org/web/20071008123746/http://www.hawkwings.net/2007/03/03/scripts-to-automate-the-mailapp-envelope-speed-trick/
# - Originally by "pmbuko" with modifications by Romulo
# - Updated by Brett Terpstra 2012
# - Updated by Mathias TÃ¶rnblom 2015 to support V3 in El Capitan and still keep backwards compatibility
# - Updated by Andrei Miclaus 2017 to support V4 in Sierra
# - Updated by Austin Ziegler 2022 to not actually care what the OS version is (and translated to fish). The only
#   restriction is that you must have opened Mail.app at least once on any OS upgrade so that if any version changes
#   have happened, Mail.app has taken care of that for you.
